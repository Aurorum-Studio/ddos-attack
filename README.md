# Aurorum-Studio/DDos-Attack-py3

A new update is on the way.

## Introduce to this project:
This is a single-file script writes in python 3 to accomplish ddos attack. DDos attack is a kind of hack attack that is usually used to crash the target server by sending it too much useless data. You can run this script on any devices with python 3 installed. It's very simple to use, the command would be introduced in the following part. Give me a star if you like this project.

## First, what is DDos attack?
A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make an online service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. They target a wide variety of important resources from banks to news websites, and present a major challenge to prevent people from publishing and accessing important information.

## Then, how to download and install this script?
First, you need to ensure that your computer has installed a python 3 environment, if you didn't, or you don't know if you have installed or not, please read this article. https://www.codecademy.com/article/install-python3 , or 中文 https://www.runoob.com/python3/python3-install.html

After installed python 3, it's really simple to download and install the script, if you are using a Linux-based system, or system with easy-to-use command line, follow this guide:
    
    git clone https://github.com/Aurorum-Studio/DDos-Attack-py3/
    cd DDos-Attack
    chmod +x ddos-attack.py  #This line could be skipped in most situation
    python ddos-attack.py
    
And it's done, it's very simple!

For those people who use systems like Windows, or Android, which have easy-to-use graphical user interface, follow this guide:
    
    1. Follow this link to download the project
       https://github.com/Aurorum-Studio/DDos-Attack-py3/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
    2. Unzip the zip file, and open the folder.
    3. Run the python file using the python IDE you have on your device.
    
## Now, it's time to get to know how to use the script, it's even easier. 
I have include a guide in the script, and what you need to do is just to follow the script, and enter the information of the target.
