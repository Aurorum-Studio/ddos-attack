## Introduce to this project:
This is a single-file script writes in python 3 to accomplish ddos attack. DDos attack is a kind of hack attack that is usually used to crash the target server by sending it too much useless data. You can run this script on any devices with python 3 installed. It's very simple to use, the command would be introduced in the following part. Give me a star if you like this project.

## First, what is DDos attack?
A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make an online service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. They target a wide variety of important resources from banks to news websites, and present a major challenge to prevent people from publishing and accessing important information.

## Then, how to download and install this script?
First, you need to ensure that your computer has installed a python 3 environment, if you didn't, or you don't know if you have installed or not, please read this article. https://www.codecademy.com/article/install-python3 , or 中文 https://www.runoob.com/python3/python3-install.html
